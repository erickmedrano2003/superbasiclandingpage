# superbasiclandingpage
I am in the process of learning web development.

Update: I've decided to make a landing page revolving around saving the planet. Save the Earth!

Update 2: This is fun, I think I have too much CSS though. I forget some styles are inhereted and target the children directly ._. 

Update 3: I have completed the full layout of the page. I might come back and add functionality later but this was simply to gain intimacy with html and css. Oh and thinking of color schemes that go good together is a major pain... After looking at my code I also realized I have lots to learn and can definetely make improvements. My sixth sense for code is telling me there are better ways to achieve my desired results. I will not rest until I find it. Agent [REDACTED] signing out.
